                <ul>
                    <li>The server to server methods should be functional.</li>

                        <span>auth_juce</span> hasn't been fully tested, but it has

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    The Plugin Licensor API has reached the debugging 
                    stage. This API will allow you to license software made with JUCE. The 
                    API has multi-lingual support, but you have to configure it in the 
                    <a href="#createplugin"><span>create_plugin</span></a> API call..
                </p>
                <h3 id="licensetypes">Licenses</h3>
                <p>
                    Just a note: these licenses will be invalidated if there is any change 
                    to the end user's motherboard or CPU, unless someone finds an even better 
                    way to get some good hardware identifiers than JUCE's 
                    <span>SystemStats::getUniqueDeviceId()</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This issue is acceptable, since I will develop another API call that 
                    will allow the end user to regenerate their license code and remove 
                    all the machines from their license.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can find our supported license types 
                    <a href="#enabled_license_types">here</a>.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Currently, only a few license types are available. There's the 
                    "lax" license, "offline" license, "online" license,
                </p>

                    All of the server-to-server requests with

                        Alternatively, you can leave this field empty and use the default Plugin Licensor 
                        2048 bit keypair, but that is not recommended. We will add automatic key generation eventually.

                        This array of Language support objects allows for sending responses to the 
                        end user in different languages.
                    </p>
                    <h5>language_name</h5>
                    <ul><li>
                        The language_name doesn't need to be a complete langauge name, but it does need to be unique compared 
                        to any other language_names you set for this plugin, and it needs to be less than 6 characters long. 
                        It is merely an id that you will need to use in your JUCE software when calling 
                        <span>auth_juce</span>. To use this with multiple languages, you will either need to:
                        <br><ul>
                            <li>Make individual versions of plugins in different languages, and changing the call to <span>auth_juce</span>.</li>
                            <li>Implement a language selection menu, and establish a relationship between the selected language and <span>language_name</span>.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        That might sound complicated, but if you want your UI and the responses from the licensing service to be 
                        in the same language, all you have to do is fill this out for each language your UI comes in.

                        <li>
                            You can use {first}, {last}, and/or {full} to insert the license owner's name 
                            into the message, but only if you provide us with their names in

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can use {ratio} to output the ratio of how many machines are on the license to

                        This list of license data will determine how often plugins 
                        expire, and how often the plugin reauthenticates with the API.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The type name must be one of the license type names listed below. 
                        The subscription license type will appear to work at first, but there 
                        isn't an API method that pushes back the expiration date... yet.
                    </p>

                        <li>Offline<ul><li>
                            The offline license type has no expiration on the client side, 
                            and it occassionally checks back with our server to check if 
                            the license is still active. You can configure how often it checks 
                            using the following parameters
                        </li></ul></li>
                        <li>Online<ul><li>
                            The online license type expires on the client side, 
                            and it occassionally checks back with our server to refresh the 
                            expiration and check if the license is still active. You can 
                            configure this

                        <li>Lax<ul><li>
                            The lax license type never expires and it never contacts the server 
                            again after the machine is registered, <b>but</b> machines on this 
                            license <b>cannot</b> be removed since the machines will not contact 
                            the server. This might be bypassable by requiring the end user to 
                            deactivate the license online, but that method could be abused.
                        </li></ul></li>
                        <li>Trial<ul><li>
                            The trial license type expires on the client side, 
                            and it occassionally checks back with our server to refresh the 
                            expiration and check if the license was upgraded. You can 
                            configure this in the following parameters.
                        </li></ul></li>
                        <li>Subscription (not fully implemented)<ul><li>
                            The subscription license checks back with our server to check if 
                            the subscription is still active. You can configure how often it checks 
                            using the following parameters
                        </li></ul></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>expiration_days</h5>
                    <p>this is required for the following license <span>type_name</span>s:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Online</li>
                        <li>Trial</li>
                        <li>Subscription</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For online licenses, this will allow the user to use your software for 
                        this many days without authenticating with our service. A generous expiration time 
                        would be 60+ days.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For trial and subscription licenses, this is how long the trial or subscription 
                        period lasts.
                    </p>

                    <h5>frequency_days</h5>

                        <li>Online</li>
                        <li>Trial</li>
                        <li>Subscription</li>
                        <li>Offline</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This parameter determines how much time has to pass since the 
                        last authentication to try authenticating again. It needs to be less 
                        than expiration_days, if it is set.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For Online and Offline licenses, the frequency should be less than half of the expiration. 
                        1-14 days is okay.
                    </p>

                    <h5>expiration_leniency</h5>
                    <p>
                        This parameter is only for subscriptions. It adds this amount 
                        of days to the expiration date on the client side in case the 
                        user's machine isn't able to contact the service for this time span 
                        after the real expiration was going to be, or if the license wasn't 
                        updated in time with the client's request. You are not obligated to 
                        use this. Feel free to set it to 0.
                    </p>

                    <ul><li>
                        This is the default machine limit for one of your 
                        licenses. This can be multiplied with order quantities, 
                        or you can set a custom <span>machine_limit</span> with 
                        the <a href="#createlicense"><span>create_license</span> API method.</a>
                    </li></ul>

                    <h4>version</h4>
                    <ul><li>
                        This parameter could be used to check if there is an update available 
                        on the client side. This will not work until an undeveloped API method 
                        updates the version of a plugin.
                    </li></ul>

                        This data will be returned if the plugin was successfully created. 
                        You will need to save the plugin_id and license_types and associate it with your

                        are generated, or you could just stick with messages that you set in 
                        <span>create_plugin</span>. If you're worried about overriding the language support

                    <ul><li>
                        The user's email. This field is optional, but it will give us the 
                        opportunity to do some analysis on software license ownership. 
                        We do not sell emails. You can see exactly how emails are stored 
                        by looking at our <a href="#createlicensesource">source code</a>, 
                        except for the definition of our

                        We'll leave that implementation to your imagination.

                        Alright... I know that looks like a lot, but it will be 
                        implemented in an open source C++ library. Also, I didn't 
                        consider making certain parameters optional entirely, but 
                        most of those will be completely optional in Version 1 of this API.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here are the required parameters. All of the other ones can be set to <span>x</span></p>

                        The machine identifier.

                    <h4>client_language</h4>
                    <ul><li>
                        This is the language that the UI in, referred to using the

                    Currently, we can only support up to 20 different plugins 
                    being purchased in an order. If you need more than that, contact

                <h2>Errors</h2>
                <p>
                    There might be some errors when sending requests, but 
                    they will all have an identifier if it is a 500 error, 
                    and if it is a 400 error, it will contain a description, 
                    with server-side validation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is, however, an exception for one API method in particular 
                    that does not have these descriptive errors. That method is the 
                    <span>auth_juce</span> API method. It should do its job, 
                    but if it runs into a 500 error, it likely won't say what is wrong... 
                    so let us know if you encounter any weird errors even though you did 
                    everything as prescribed.

                    <li>
                        Added more information for auth_JUCE and 
                        <a href="#rates">Rate Limiting</a>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                    A minor bug fix that would make it impossible to get a success 
                    message from <span>auth_JUCE</span>. It occurred when the only 
                    <span>license_type</span> for a plugin was <span>offline</span>.
                </li></ul>

                <h3>v0.9.3</h3>
                <p>
                    I would call these breaking changes, but it wasn't working prior to 
                    this version, so nothing was really broken. It should be working now, 
                    but <span>auth_juce</span> still hasn't been fully tested.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed and changed the parameter names of the following API methods:<ul>
                        <li><span>register_store</span></li>
                        <li><span>create_plugin</span></li>
                        <li><span>create_license</span></li>

                <p>Added Changelog</p>
                <h3>v0.9.1</h3>
                <p>Bug fixes,  and addition of custom_success_message</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Added a way for developers to implement custom messages 
                        that are shown when the user activates their plugin.
                    </li>
                    <li>Added details about <span>Authentication</span>.</li>
                    <li>
                        Discovered and fixed a bug in <span>create_license</span>.
